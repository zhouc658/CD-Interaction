    <h1>Html Exploration</h1>
    <h3>This assignment is about creating a series of 5 unique web pages which focus on one or two HTML tags each to see how html tags look by defualt and how we can use them in an inventive way. I decided to focus on using headings, paragraphs, images, listing, and navigation.</h3>
    <h5>Note: The heading tags are also used on other pages to help organize content more clearly. Likewise, the navigation tag appears on other pages to allow users to navigate between them easily.</h5>
    
    <h2>About this Page</h2>
    <h4>This page focuses on the different heading tags. The navigation above lets you go to the other pages.</h4>

    <h2>About Paragraphs Page</h2>
    <h4>This page focuses on the paragraph tag and strong tag. The paragraph content is based on an anime summary generated by AI to quickly provide text for demonstrating how these tags look by default. </h4>

    <h2>About Mark Page</h2>
    <h4>This page focuses on the mark tag. The paragraph content is same as the paragraph page since I wanted to compare and contrast the mark and strong tag. </h4>

    <h2>About images Page</h2>
    <h4>This page focuses on the image tag. The images are of my past artworks. </h4>

    <h2>About Listing Page</h2>
    <h4>This page focuses on the listing tag. I listed out all the presents or merch I want to buy. </h4>
