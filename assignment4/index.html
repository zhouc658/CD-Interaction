    <h2>The Antagonist: Easter Corporation</h2>
    <p>The main antagonistic force is a mysterious company called <em class="e">Easter</em>, which is trying to find the <em class="e">mythical Embryo</em>, <strong>an egg said to grant any wish.</strong> To locate it, Easter <strong>corrupts children’s hearts, turning their dream eggs into X-Eggs.</strong> <em class=amu>Amu</em> and the <em class="e">Guardians</em> fight against Easter’s actions to protect children’s inner dreams.</p>
